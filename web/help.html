        <title>InteractiVenn - Interactive Venn Diagrams</title>
        <meta name="description" content="InteractiVenn is an interactive visualization tool for analyzing lists of elements using Venn diagrams. The web tool supports up to six different sets. Moreover, union operations between sets can be made. The union operations are reflected to the Venn diagram. Other interactions are also available, such as color changing and export diagram in SVG and PNG format. We suggests the use of Inkscape to edit the Venn diagrams exported by InteractiVenn." />

<div>
  <h3>Building a diagram:</h3>
  
  <p>
    To <b style="color:#C74350">build a diagram</b>, select the number of
    sets and then fill the lists of elements in each set, one element per
    line.  Optionally, fill the name of each set and select its color.
    The diagram will be updated as the set elements are entered, in most
    browsers.  If that does not happen, clicking on any other window
    region will trigger the update.  Changing the number of sets will
    preserve the element lists.</p>

  <h3>Listing the elements in each diagram region:</h3>

  <p>
    To <b style="color:#C74350">list the elements</b> in each nonempty
    diagram region, click on the numeric label of a region.  A window
    containing the list of elements in that region will pop-up.  If you
    click over multiple regions, multiple windows will be opened.</p>

  <h3>Performing set unions:</h3>

  <p>
    Unions of sets may be applied to the sets either through a binary tree
    or through a list of unions.</p>

  <p>With <b style="color:#C74350">Unions by tree</b>, a tree in Newick
    format has to be given as input.  After typing a tree, click on the
    "Start Tree" button.  The initial view corresponds to the leaves of
    the tree, where all sets are distinct.  Clicking on the "Up" button
    will go up a level in the tree, performing the set unions at that
    level.  The diagram shape will not change, but regions will be merged
    and their sizes will reflect such merging.  Similarly, clicking on the
    "Down" button will go down a level in the tree.  Click "Stop" to
    restore the original diagram.  If the tree string given as input is
    malformed, then both Up and Down buttons will be disabled.</p>

  <p>For instance, with three sets A, B and C, navigating through the
    tree <b>((A,B),C)</b> will show first a diagram where the three sets
    are distinct.  Clicking "Up" will show a diagram where A and B are
    merged.  Another click on "Up" will show a tree where sets A, B and
    C are merged.  </p>

  <p>After the start of the unions, clicking on the "Visualize tree"
    button will display the tree that was given as input. </p>

  <p>With <b style="color:#C74350">Unions by list</b>, a colon
  separated list of sets is given as input.  After typing a list,
  click on the "Start" button. The initial view corresponds to the
  unions given by the first element in the list. Clicking on the
  "&gt;" button will perform the next union in the list.  Similarly,
  Clicking on the "&lt;" button will undo the previous union in the
  list.</p>

  <p>For instance, with three sets A, B and C, navigating through the
  list <b>;ab;ca</b> will show first a diagram where the three sets
  are distinct. Clicking "&gt;" will show a diagram where only A and B
  are merged.  Another click on "&gt;" will show a diagram where A and
  C are merged.</p>

  <h3>Changing colors and font size:</h3>

  <p><b style="color:#C74350">Set
  colors</b>, <b style="color:#C74350">color opacity</b>
  and <b style="color:#C74350">font size</b> may be changed through
  the appropriate controls.  The color of a set may be changed
  clicking on the coloured square close to the set name.  Font size
  and color opacity may be increased or decreased clicking on the
  respective "+" or "-" buttons.  Clicking on "Reset diagram" will
  restore default colors and font size.  Set elements will not be
  affected.</p>


  <h3>Saving and loading:</h3>

  <p>To <b style="color:#C74350">save</b> the sets type a name for a
  file in the field tagged with the phrase "Write dataset name here"
  and click on the "Save" button.  The download will start after
  that.</p>

  <p>To <b style="color:#C74350">load</b> sets previously saved, click
    on the "Browse..." button right below the "Load Sets:" label, and
    then select the appropriate file.  The upload will start after
    that, and the sets fill be filled with data.</p>
  
  <h3>Exporting:</h3>
  
  <p>To <b style="color:#C74350">export the diagram</b> in SVG vector
  format, PNG graphic format or text format, type a name for a file in
  the field tagged with the phrase "Write file name here", right below
  the "Export current diagram:" label, select the desired format and
  click on the "Export" button.  The download will start after that.
  The text format has the elements in each nonempty diagram region.
